ASSUMPTIONS:

1. Residuals vs Fitted - this graph is showing heteroscedasticity.To correct this data. (POLINA TO CONTINUE THE VIOLATION)

2. At the second graph (Normal Q-Q) we can check the normality assumption. Our points follow a straight
line with some outliers around. This assumption is justified.The outliers are on line 36,110 and 77.

3. At the third graph (Scale â€“ Location) we can check the constant variance assumption. We can notice heteroskedasticity in our model as the points are not located around a horizontal line but they follow a 'V' shape.

4. THe third graph shows us our outliers. The outliers are on line 24,36,77 (ALUN TO CONTINUE ON OUTLIERS)
