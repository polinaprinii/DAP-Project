##*Project Aim:*



##*Individual Work:*
This area outlines the individual efforts to extract, clean and transform the datasets under analysis with the end goal of combining said datasets into one for Multiple Linear Regression.

###Total Vaccinations - Polina Prinii
The Total Vaccination dataset aims to look and identify the following totals:

- Total vaccines administered to the population for each country (inclusive of 2 dose protocols).
- Number of fully vaccinated individuals.
- Total boosters administered to the population.

The dataset in question looks at the following period of 01/01/2021 to 24/11/2021. With the aim to predict mortality rates for the upcoming year.

***Programmatic Approach:***

The following programmatic approach is used to extract, transform, load and analyse data in preparation for Multiple Linear Regression.<br />
Note all scripting is undertaken using the Python programming language.

**Step 1:** Environment setup in PyCharm to store all coding undertaken throughout the process.<br />
**Step 2:** Extract raw datasets from Git. <br />
**Step 3:** Import raw dataset to MongoDB.
**Step 4:** Transform datasets in MongoDB.
**Step 5:** Import datasets to PostgreSQL.
**Step 6:** Assign relationships within tables in PostgreSQL.
**Step 7:** Visualise data in meaningful ways.
**Step 8:** Export final table aka dataset for groups efforts in CSV format.
