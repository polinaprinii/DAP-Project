## *Project Aim:* ##
(Polina take)
-The project aims to perform analysis using the data collated by the individual work (outlined below) to estimate and report on a multiple regression model to facilitate the understanding of the criteria that dictate the Covid-19 mortality rates and useful for the prediction of same.
Taking the following approach of programmatically combining four CSV datasets via Python and using the rpy2 package to allow for the multiple linear regression analysis the project looks to conclude the finding in this report. (insert link to report)-  

## *Individual Work:* ##
This area outlines the individual efforts to extract, clean and transform the datasets under analysis with the end goal of combining said datasets into one for Multiple Linear Regression.

### Total Vaccinations - Polina Prinii ###
The Total Vaccination dataset aims to look and identify the following totals:

- Total vaccines administered to the population for each country (inclusive of 2 dose protocols).
- Number of fully vaccinated individuals.
- Total boosters administered to the population.

The dataset in question looks at the following period of 01/01/2021 to 24/11/2021. With the aim to predict mortality rates for the upcoming year.

***Programmatic Approach:***

The following programmatic approach is used to extract, transform, load and analyse data in preparation for Multiple Linear Regression.<br />
Note all scripting is undertaken using the Python programming language.

**Step 1:** Environment setup in PyCharm to store all coding undertaken throughout the process.<br />
**Step 2:** Extract raw datasets from Git. <br />
**Step 3:** Import raw dataset to MongoDB.<br />
**Step 4:** Transform datasets in MongoDB.<br />
**Step 5:** Import datasets to PostgreSQL.<br />
**Step 6:** Assign relationships within tables in PostgreSQL.<br />
**Step 7:** Visualise data in meaningful ways.<br />
**Step 8:** Export final table aka dataset for groups efforts in CSV format. <br />
